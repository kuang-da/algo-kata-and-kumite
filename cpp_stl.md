You should use STL unless:

* The question is asking for the same function/data structure, i.e do not use priority_queue or heap functions of STL, if the question is to implement a heap.

* The questioner mentions it specifically.

In general using STL functions are better, since it

* Better reflects real world scenario

* Avoids reinventing the wheel

* Allows faster and better code.

* Usually STL libraries function better and are tested better

As always it never hurts to clarify with the interviewer on what you are thinking about.
